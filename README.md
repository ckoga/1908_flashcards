# FlashCards

## Abstract

Flashcards is a project designed to strengthen the Test Driven Development process.  It helps to highlight the importance of writing tests first to reduce bugs and maintain SRP code.  One really important aspect is making sure the code/tests I wrote works correctly with the already existing code in the starter kit.  Using mocha and chai for this project allowed me to get a better handle on assertion statements and the syntax for using expect.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your `Card` test file that show up.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```
